#   Note that the on/off switch has 1 fewer effect, which makes its math slightly different than the dimmers or other devices with a full LED bar.

# Required parameters
#   entity: (string) The entity ID from "Developer Tools" -> "States".  The device to be modified (e.g. light.office_lights_level)
#           Can also be a comma separated list, if all entities are the same model.  For example, "light.office, light.family_room"
#   model: (string) One of: dimmer, switch, combo_light, combo_fan

# Required for setting the LED indicator
#   LEDcolor: (int or string) Sets color of LED status and must be one of: Off, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Teal, Blue, Purple, Light Pink, Pink, White
#   LEDbrightness: (whole integer 1 – 10) Sets the brightness of the LED status when on.
#   LEDbrightness_off: (whole integer 1 – 10) Sets the brightness of the LED status when off.

# Required for setting LED effects
#   duration: (string or whole integer of seconds) Either "Off", an integer of seconds, or a whole integer followed by "Second", "Seconds", "Minute", or "Minutes", "Hour", "Hours", "Indefinitely", or "Forever".
#   effect: (string) One of: "Off", "Solid", "Chase" (not available on switches), "Fast Blink", "Slow Blink", "Blink", or "Pulse".
#   brightness: (integer 1 – 10) Sets the brightness of the LED's effect
#   color: (string) Sets color of LED effect and must be one of: Off, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Teal, Blue, Purple, Light Pink, Pink, White

# Default will be to clear the effect and set the duration to 1sec.  
# Setting only the effect to "off" turned the LED off on LZW36 fan / light combos for the duration (which could be "forever").
#    This way it turns off for 1 sec before it returns to its default state, but until the min value for effect changes to 0 in the DB, that's the best I can do.
# This way, "forever" effects can be set, then easily cleared.
# It's also a safer way to fail since the worst case scenario is that an effect is cleared.
